/*          This is a simple script that will be used to demonstrate the use of the temperature converter class.

The script will create an instance of the TemperatureConverter class and use it to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin.

The html file will accept a temperature input and a select dropdown to choose the unit of the input temperature. The user will then be able to select the unit they would like to convert the temperature to and click a button to perform the conversion.

The result of the conversion will be displayed on the page.

The script will also include a function to validate the input temperature and display an error message if the input is not a valid number.

Steps:

1. Create an instance of the TemperatureConverter class.
2. Create a function to validate the input temperature.
3. Create a function to convert the temperature.
4. Create a function to display the result of the conversion.
5. Add event listener to the button to perform the conversion.
6. Display the result on the page.
